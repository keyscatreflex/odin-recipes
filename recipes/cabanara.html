                <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>&frac12; cup white wine</li>
                <li>1 &frac12; cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 gallon water</li>
                <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
                <li>2 cups frozen peas</li>

            <h4 class="steps">Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                <li>Cook pancetta in a medium sauce pan over medium-low heat until meat is crisp. Remove meat from pan with a slotted spoon. Using a paper towel, remove excess fat from meat. Drain fat from sauce pan, reserving 2 tablespoons of the drippings.</li>
                <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon bacon drippings in sauce pan over medium heat. Cook chicken breast halves in the meat drippings until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. A thermometer should read 165 degrees F. Transfer to cutting board and tent with foil. Rest chicken for 5 min before slicing; set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining tablespoon of fat until simmering. Cook and stir garlic and ground black pepper in pan until fregrant, about 30 seconds. Pour wine into pan; cook at simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Whisk Parmesan cheese and eggs together in a bowl. Slowly stream wine mixture into the Parmesan mixture while whisking continually.</li>
                <li>Bring large pot of generously salted water to boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite; about 12 minutes. Remove &frac12;cup of water from the pot for later use.</li>
                <li>Put peas in a large colander. Drain pasta in the colander with peas. Return drained pasta and peas to the pot. Stir pancetta, chicken, and wine mixture into the spaghetti. Thin sauce with reserved pasta water as desired. </li>
