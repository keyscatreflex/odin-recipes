Project: Recipes

Hello, this is my first project within The Odin Project. It will be a recipe site.

As of Tuesday July 25 2023 I have completed the first, second, third, and fourth iteration of the recipes website within the project recipes lesson. I have linked pages to my index.html, styled and customized the li, a, p, h1, h2, and h3 elements and have styled the pages with uniformity in regard to font, color and presentation.
